# TURNtoURN

## Contents

###Transformation from TURN to URN using ATL
  
**ATL -** Phase 1 of transformation. Turn2Urn.atl is the primary transformation file and **uses** ConnectNodes.atl using Module Superimposition  
  
**Input -** TURN model saved in .xml format (sample file provided)  
  
**Output -** .jucm output generated by transformation  
  
**Metamodels -** Turn.ecore    
  
**Expected Outputs -** expected output .jucm files for all test cases  
  
**Turn2UrnPhase2.java -** Phase 2 of transformation 

## TODO
* Remove debug & TODO statements
* Refactor for increased readability
	* Make approach to adding / removing items to sequences and maps more consistent
	* Rearrange methods so that their order feels more natural.
	* Make variable name orderings in method arguments consistent
	* Rename methods and variables so that their names better describe their behavior and contents respectively
	* Rename variable names in 'using' blocks with a better convention
	* Write down the return type for each called rule
* Refactor for increased consistency
	* All if and else loops, including single line ones, should have braces
	* Need consistency with whether empty from / to items have () or not
	* Make sure all select(n.name='') are consistent in (Turn2Urn remains)
	* Files
		* Update names of .turn input files in TURNTestInput to match with new xml file names
		* Update names of files and test cases to be consistent with names of turn/urn items (e.g., Endpoint to EndPoint)
		* Create a "test" folder to contain Input, Output, LaunchConfiguration, previousOutput (or find some other way to structure the directory better than its current more arbitrary state)
		* Describe in this README how to use the launch configurations that have been added to the project
	* TURN
		* Check if it is acceptable to rename some TURN variables for more consistency in naming
			* EndpointWithConnect vs EndPoint
			* LongName.longname
			* Softgoal
		* Why is failLabel an object with failure as a property rather than just a string failLabel?

* New TODO (will be categorized later):
	* Determine which attributes are not being tested (e.g., author in tStrategies)
	* Find a way to remove the maps used in the transform
	* Write comments describing what rules do

## Style
	* Variable naming:
		* Prefixes:
			* v = primitive data type
			* s = source MM data type
			* t = target MM data type
		* Name:
			* Depending on the context, write either a descriptive name for the element or otherwise use the full name of the model item 
				* (e.g., sEndPoint says that an element is a Turn!EndPoint)
	* Conditionals:
		* All if and else loops, including single line ones, should have braces
