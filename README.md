# TURNtoURN

## Transformation from TURN to URN using ATL
  
**ATL -** Phase 1 of transformation. Turn2Urn.atl is the primary transformation file and **uses** ConnectNodes.atl using Module Superimposition  
  
**Input -** TURN model saved in .xml format (sample file provided)  
  
**Output -** .jucm output generated by transformation  
  
**Metamodels -** Turn.ecore    
  
**Expected Outputs -** expected output .jucm files for all test cases  
  
**Turn2UrnPhase2.java -** Phase 2 of transformation 

## TODO
* Replace "conns" for "connections" where relevant (if conns does indeed stand for connections)
* Helpers:
		* orForkNodeConnCounter
		* andForkNodeConnCounter
	* Rules:
		* createNodeConns
		* createOrForkNodeConns
		* createAndForkNodeConns
* Decide on a naming convention for source and target model elements. Either stick to s and t or have the names be descriptive.
* Continue returning code from Turn2UrnTemporarilyRemovedCode.txt to Turn2URN.atl. Refactor it and improve its efficiency as you go.
* Start returning code from ConnectNodesTemporarilyRemovedCode to ConnectNodes.atl. Refactor it and improve its efficiency as you go.
